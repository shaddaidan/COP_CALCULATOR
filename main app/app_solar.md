# 🌞 Solar-Powered Refrigerator COP Calculator 🌡️

This Python script calculates the **Coefficient of Performance (COP)** of a solar-powered refrigerator. It evaluates the refrigerator's efficiency based on user inputs like compressor power, ambient temperature, battery capacity, battery efficiency, and solar irradiance.

## 📝 Parameters
- **Compressor Power (W):** Average power consumption of the refrigerator.
- **Ambient Temperature (°C):** The temperature of the surrounding environment.
- **Battery Capacity (Ah):** Capacity of the battery system.
- **Battery Efficiency (decimal):** Efficiency of the battery.
- **Average Solar Irradiance (W/m²):** Solar energy received per square meter.


## 🚀 How to Use
1. **Input Parameters:** Run the script and provide the required parameters when prompted.
2. **Calculate COP:** The script will compute the COP value and display it.

## 🔧 Installation
- Requires Python 3.x.
- No additional dependencies. Simply run the script!
