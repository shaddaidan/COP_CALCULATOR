# 🌞 Refrigerator COP Calculator 🌡️

This Python script calculates the **Coefficient of Performance (COP)** of a refrigerator. It evaluates the refrigerator's efficiency based on user inputs like cooling capacity in BTU/hr and compressor power in watts.

## 📝 Parameters
- **Cooling Capacity (BTU/hr):** The cooling capacity of the refrigerator.
- **Compressor Power (W):** The power consumption of the compressor.

## 📊 Formula
The script calculates COP using the formula:

\[ \text{COP} = \frac{\text{Cooling Capacity (W)}}{\text{Compressor Power (W)}} \]

Where:
- Cooling Capacity (W) is converted from BTU/hr using the conversion factor \(1 \, \text{W} = 3.412 \, \text{BTU/hr}\):
  \[ \text{Cooling Capacity (W)} = \frac{\text{Cooling Capacity (BTU/hr)}}{3.412} \]

## 🚀 How to Use
1. **Input Parameters:** Run the script and provide the required parameters when prompted:
   - Cooling capacity in BTU/hr
   - Compressor power in watts
2. **Calculate COP:** The script will compute the COP value and display it.

## 🔧 Installation
- Requires Python 3.x.
- No additional dependencies. Simply run the script!
